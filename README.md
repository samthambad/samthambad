## Hi there 👋
I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at NUS, interested in building high-performance, practical software systems.

🌱 Currently studying relational databases, digital logic design, and statistics.

🔒 Building a private trading platform in Rust.

## Projects

- NUSMods Timetable Optimiser – Uses graph-based algorithms and user preferences to generate convenient timetables; currently in beta testing with NUSMods.

- Tic-Tac-Toe Engine – Implemented with the Minimax algorithm and clean game-state evaluation.

- Full-stack Marketplace (Next.js, TypeScript) – Early full-stack project currently being revisited and stabilised.
